'''
You are given a string s representing an expression containing various types of brackets: {}, (), and []. Your task is to determine whether the brackets in the expression are balanced. A balanced expression is one where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

Examples :

Input: s = "{([])}"
Output: true
Explanation: 
- In this expression, every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
- The first bracket { is closed by }, the second opening bracket ( is closed by ), and the third opening bracket [ is closed by ].
- As all brackets are properly paired and closed in the correct order, the expression is considered balanced.

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Explanation: 
- This expression contains only one type of bracket, the parentheses ( and ).
- The opening bracket ( is matched with its corresponding closing bracket ).
- Since they form a complete pair, the expression is balanced.

Input: s = "([]"
Output: false
Explanation: 
- This expression contains only one type of bracket, the parentheses ( and ).
- The opening bracket ( is matched with its corresponding closing bracket ).
- Since they form a complete pair, the expression is balanced.
